# Configuring git for the first time
Configure user information for all local repositories

- ## Configure email
Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions:
```
git config --global user.email "[email address]"
```
## Configure name

Sets the name you want attached to your commit transactions:

```
git config --global user.name "[name]"
```

# Setting up SSH keys
To push your changes to the remote repo, you would need the SSH keys set up.

You can use the command below in `git bash` and get a pair of keys.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C <email>
```

**This would generate 2 keys- public and private**

##  Add public key to your github account
Login to your account and navigate to settings.

##  Add private keys to ssh agent.

- `start ssh agent: `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`

- `ssh-add <your-key>` or `ssh-add ~/.ssh/key`.

# Workflow of changes

Changes are made locally in the working area.
Then they are staged and then pushed.

![img](./images/Workflow.png)

## Staging changes
Stage files for tracking them by using the command: `git add`.

The command below adds all the files in the repo to staging area:

```
git add .
```


## Committing changes

Once changes move to the staging area, you can commit them with a proper commit message.
See section [Writing a good commit message](#git-commit-messages)

## Pushing the changes

To push your changes to the remote repo, you can use the `git push` command.

```
 git push origin main
```
Here, main is the name of the branch and can be replaced with another branch you are working on.


# Working on changes from remote repository to local machine
- **Cloning**
Clone a repo by going to a specific repo and selecting `https` from `code` button.

# Working on changes from local machine to remote repository

In your current directory, initailize the git repository using `git init`.

To the push changes, create a repo in GitHub.
- Link the remote repo: `git remote add origin <ssh-link-to-remote-repo>`.
- Verify of the branch has been added: `git remote -v`. 
- Push the files and changes: `git push origin main`.

**Set upstream  manually:**
- To set upstream: `git push -u origin main`.
- Once set, now you can simply use `git push`.

# Git branches
>üí° Tip and a good practice: Always  make changes in a forked branch.

Branches fall into these categories:
- **Main**: The original/main branch.
- **Feature branch**: Used when you are adding a feature.
- **Hot fix branch**: Created for bugs in production releases. Used as a patch for next release cycle.

Branches often start with fix/ or feat/, among others, like commit messages, but they use a forward slash and can't contain spaces. Create a new branch named feat/add-create-table-reference

## Check which branch you are on.
`git branch`

## Create and switch to a new branch
`git checkout -b <branch-name> `


## Switch to an existing branch 
`git chekout main`.

## Push to a feature branch
`git push origin <feature-branch-name>`

## Delete branches that are not in use
`git branch -d feature-branch`


# Forking

forking creates a copy of the original repo in your account.
Then you can make chaneges in a branch and then create a PR(Pull Request)

![img](./images/fork%23.gif)

# Upstream- adding and reviewing upstreams
## Add main upstream of original repo

```
git remote add upstream <ssh-of -orignal repo>
```
Use HTTPS to avoid SSH keys

```
git remote add upstream <https-of -orignal repo>
```

When fetching from upstream,
- Switch to master: `git checkout main`.
- Fetch: `git fetch upstream`.
- Merge changes: `git merge upstream main`.

> `git pull` does `git fetch upstream` and `git merge upstream main`in one go.

## Push changes to remote
`git push origin <branch-name>`

Make sure upstream is configured.

#  Additional information
## How to Recover a Deleted File in Git ‚Äì Revert Changes After a Hard Reset
### Revert file after committing changes:
**Method:1**

- Find hash ID, use: `git log` 
- Revert change: `git checkout <hash-id>`

**Method:2**

- Find hash ID: `git reflog`.
- Revert change:  `git reflog <hash-id>`.

### How to Recover Files When Changes Are Staged but Not Committed

- Find dangling blobs: `git fsk`.
- View details: `git show`.
- Save in a file: `git show <hash-id> > output.txt`.

# Git commit messages

The commit message should follow a structure like this:
This makes it easy to understand your changes in a glance.

```git
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

Some commonly-used conventions.

-   `chore:`  Changes that don't change source code or tests.
-   `docs:`  Changes to the documentation.
-   `feat:`  Added new feature.
-   `fix:`  A bug fix
-   `build:`  Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
-   `style:`  Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
-   `test:`  Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
